# Data_Science_Projects
Repository to store all projects related to Data Science using Python, SQL, and Machine Learning

## Computer Vision Project:
------
### Malaria Detection:
Detect malaria from red blood cell images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 10 models with ANN, CNN, transfer learning from pre-trained models and CNN on image with data Augmentation are evaluated.  

## Hackathon:  
------
Participation in Hackathon to predict the overall experience of passengers that travel by Shinkansen Bullet Train, using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and ANNs and achieving 94.5% accuracy

## ML:  
------
Including other Machine Learning Projects.  

## AWS SageMaker Classification Deployment  
------
This project contains two distinct machine learning projects focused on deploying classification models using AWS SageMaker. The projects are designed to address real-world problems in visa approval prediction and hotel reservation cancellation prediction. Both projects leverage AWS SageMaker for efficient model deployment and pipeline management.
