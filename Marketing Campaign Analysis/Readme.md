# **Project: Marketing Campaign Analysis**
---------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the project on Foundations for Data Science. In this project, we aim to analyze the marketing data and address some key business questions.

---------------------
## **Context**
---------------------

Marketing Analytics broadly refers to the practice of using analytical methods and techniques to understand the effectiveness of various marketing activities and deploy data-driven decisions to optimize for ROI on conversion rates. It typically involves analyzing various metrics around customer engagement with various marketing activities including but not limited to, ATL (above the line) marketing activities, BTL (below the line) campaigns, and targeting personalized offers. Typically the variables of interest are customer profile, campaign conversion rates, and costs associated with various marketing channels. These can generate valuable insights that can help an organization form better marketing strategies, optimize/innovate on delivery, and achieve overall growth.
